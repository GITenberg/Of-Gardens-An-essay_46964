</div>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 70px;">
<img src="images/g.jpg" width="70" height="57" alt="G" /></span>OD almighty first planted a garden: and indeed it is the
purest of human pleasures. It is the greatest refreshment
of the spirits of man; without which, buildings or
palaces are but gross handy-works: and a man shall ever
see, that when ages grow to civility or elegancy, men
come to build stately, sooner than to garden finely,
as if gardening were the greater perfection. I do hold
it, in the royal ordering of gardens, there ought to
be gardens for all the months in the year: in which,
severally, things of beauty may be then in season. For
December and January, or the latter part of November, you
must take such things as are green all winter; holly,
ivy, bays, juniper, cypress-trees, yew, pine-apple trees,
fir trees, rosemary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span> lavender, periwinkle (the white, the purple, and the blue),
germander, flags, orange trees, lemon trees, and myrtles, if they be
stoved, and sweet marjoram, warm set. There followeth, for the latter
part of January and February, the mezereon tree, which then blossoms;
crocus vernus, both the yellow and the gray; primroses, anemonies, the
early tulip, hyacinthus orientalis, chamaïris, fritellaria. For March
there come violets, especially the single blue, which are the earliest;
the yellow daffodil, the daisy, the almond tree in blossom, the peach
tree in blossom, the cornelian tree in blossom, sweet briar. In April
follow the double white violet, the wallflower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
the stock-gilliflower,
the cowslip, flower-de-luces, and lilies of all natures,
rosemary-flowers, the tulip, the double piony, the pale daffodil, the
French honeysuckle, the cherry tree in blossom, the damascene and plum
trees in blossom, the white-thorn in leaf, the lilach-tree. In May and
June come pinks of all sorts, especially the blush pink; roses of all
kinds, except the musk, which comes later; honeysuckles, strawberries,
bugloss, columbine, the French marygold, flos Africanus, cherry-tree
in fruit, ribes, figs in fruit, rasps, vine-flowers, lavender in
flowers, the sweet satyrian, with the white flower; herba muscaria,
lilium convalium,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
the apple tree in blossom. In July come gilliflowers
of all varieties, musk roses, the lime tree in blossom, early pears
and plums in fruit, gennitings, codlins. In August come plums of all
sorts in fruit, pears, apricots, berberries, filberds, musk melons,
monks-hoods, of all colours. In September comes grapes, apples, poppies
of all colours, peaches, melo-cotones, nectarines, cornelians, wardens,
quinces. In October, and the beginning of November, come services,
medlars, bullaces, roses cut or removed to come late, holly oaks, and
such-like. These particulars are for the climate of London: but my
meaning is perceived, that you may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
‘ver perpetuum,’ as the place
affords.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/0021.jpg" width="250" height="20" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 70px;">
<img src="images/a.jpg" width="70" height="61" alt="A" /></span>ND because the breath
of flowers is far sweeter in the air, where it
comes and goes, like the warbling of music, than in the hand, therefore
nothing is more fit for that delight, than to know what be the flowers
and plants that do best perfume the air. Roses, damask and red, are
fast flowers of their smells; so that you may walk by a whole row of
them, and find nothing of their sweetness: yea, though it be in a
morning’s dew. Bays likewise yield no smell as they grow; rosemary
little; nor sweet marjoram. That which above all others yields the
sweetest smell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
in the air, is the violet; especially the white double
violet, which comes twice a year, about the middle of April, and about
Bartholomew-tide. Next to that is the muskrose; then the strawberry
leaves dying, with a most excellent cordial smell; then the flower of
the vines—it is a little dust, like the dust of a bent, which grows
upon the cluster, in the first coming forth; then sweet-brier; then
wallflowers, which are very delightful, to be set under a parlour,
or lower chamber window; then pinks and gilliflowers, especially the
matted pink and clove-gilli-flower; then the flowers of the lime tree;
then the honeysuckles, so they be somewhat afar off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Of bean flowers I speak not, because they are field flowers; but those
which perfume the air most delightfully, not passed by as the rest, but
being trodden upon and crushed, are three; that is, burnet, wild thyme,
and water mints. Therefore you are to set whole alleys of them, to have
the pleasure when you walk or tread.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/0023.jpg" width="200" height="20" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 70px;">
<img src="images/f.jpg" width="70" height="64" alt="F" /></span>OR gardens, speaking
of those which are indeed princelike, as we have
done of buildings, the contents ought not well to be under thirty
acres of ground, and to be divided into three parts: a green in the
entrance; a heath or desert in the going forth; and the main garden in
the midst; besides alleys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
on both sides. And I like well, that four
acres of ground be assigned to the green, six to the heath, four and
four to either side, and twelve to the main garden. The green hath
two pleasures: the one, because nothing is more pleasant to the eye
than green grass kept finely shorn; the other, because it will give
you a fair alley in the midst; by which you may go in front upon a
stately hedge, which is to inclose the garden. But because the alley
will be long, and in great heat of the year or day, you ought not to
buy the shade in the garden by going in the sun through the green;
therefore, you are, of either side the green, to plant a covert alley,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
upon carpenter’s work, about twelve foot in height, by which you may
go in shade into the garden. As for the making of knots or figures,
with divers coloured earths, that they may lie under the windows of
the house, on that side which the garden stands, they be but toys; you
may see as good sights, many times, in tarts. The garden is best to be
square, encompassed on all the four sides with a stately arched hedge:
the arches to be upon pillars of carpenter’s work, of some ten foot
high, and six foot broad; and the spaces between of the same dimension
with the breadth of the arch. Over the arches let there be an entire
hedge, of some four foot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
high, framed also upon carpenter’s work; and
upon the upper hedge, over every arch, a little turret, with a belly
enough to receive a cage of birds; and over every space between the
arches, some other little figure, with broad plates of round coloured
glass, gilt, for the sun to play upon. But this hedge I intend to be
raised upon a bank, not steep, but gently slope, of some six foot, set
all with flowers. Also I understand, that this square of the garden
should not be the whole breadth of the ground, but to leave on either
side ground enough for diversity of side alleys; into which the two
covert alleys of the green may deliver you; but there must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
be no alleys with hedges at
either end of this great enclosure; not at the
hither end, for letting your prospect upon the fair hedge from the
green; nor at the further end, for letting your prospect from the
hedge, through the arches, upon the heath.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 240px;">
<img src="images/0027.jpg" width="240" height="20" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 70px;">
<img src="images/f.jpg" width="70" height="64" alt="F" /></span>OR the ordering of the
ground within the great hedge, I leave it to
variety of device; advising nevertheless, that whatsoever form you cast
it into, first it be not too busy, or full of work; wherein I, for my
part, do not like images cut out in juniper or other garden stuff;
they be for children. Little low hedges round, like welts, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
some pretty pyramids, I like
well; and in some places, fair columns upon
frames of carpenter’s work. I would also have the alleys spacious and
fair. You may have closer alleys upon the side grounds, but none in
the main garden. I wish also, in the very middle, a fair mount, with
three ascents and alleys, enough for four to walk a-breast; which I
would have to be perfect circles, without any bulwarks or embossments;
and the whole amount to be thirty foot high; and some fine banqueting
house, with some chimneys neatly cast, and without too much glass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/0028.jpg" width="220" height="20" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 70px;">
<img src="images/f.jpg" width="70" height="64" alt="F" /></span>OR fountains, they are
a great beauty and refreshment;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
but pools mar all, and make the garden
unwholesome, and full of flies and frogs.
Fountains I intend to be of two natures: the one that sprinkleth or
spouteth water; the other a fair receipt of water, of some thirty or
forty foot square, but without fish, or slime, or mud. For the first,
the ornaments of images gilt, or of marble, which are in use, do well:
but the main matter is so to convey the water, as it never stay either
in the bowls, or in the cistern; that the water be never by rest
discoloured, green or red, or the like; or gather any mossiness or
putrefaction. Besides that, it is to be cleansed every day by the hand.
Also some steps up to it, and some fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
pavement about it doth well.
As for the other kind of fountain, which we may call a bathing pool,
it may admit much curiosity and beauty, wherewith we will not trouble
ourselves; as, that the bottom be finely paved, and with images; the
sides likewise: and withal embellished with coloured glass, and such
things of lustre; encompassed also with fine rails of low statues. But
the main point is the same which we mentioned in the former kind of
fountain; which is, that the water be in perpetual motion, fed by a
water higher than the pool, and delivered into it by fair spouts, and
then discharged away under ground by some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
equality of bores, that it
stay little. And for fine devices of arching water without spilling,
and making it rise in several forms, of feathers, drinking glasses,
canopies, and the like, they be pretty things to look on, but nothing
to health and sweetness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 210px;">
<img src="images/0031.jpg" width="210" height="20" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 70px;">
<img src="images/f.jpg" width="70" height="64" alt="F" /></span>OR the health, which was the third part of our plot, I wish it to be
framed as much as may be to a natural wildness. Trees I would have none
in it, but some thickets made only of sweet-brier and honeysuckle, and
some wild vine amongst; and the ground set with violets, strawberries,
and primroses. For these are sweet, and prosper in the shade. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>And
these to be in the heath here &amp; there, not in any order. I like
also little heaps, in the nature of mole-hills, such as are in wild
heaths, to be set, some with wild thyme, some with pinks, some with
germander, that gives a good flower to the eye, some with periwinkle,
some with violets, some with strawberries, some with cowslips, some
with daisies, some with red roses, some with lilium convallium, some
with sweet-williams red, some with bears-foot, and the like low
flowers, being withal sweet and sightly. Part of which heaps to be
with standards of little bushes, pricked upon their top, and part
without. The standards to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>roses, juniper, holly, berberries, but
here and there, because of the smell of their blossom, red currants,
gooseberries, rosemary, bays, sweet-brier, and such-like. But these
standards to be kept with cutting, that they may not grow out of course.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/0021.jpg" width="250" height="20" alt="" />
</div>
<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 70px;">
<img src="images/f.jpg" width="70" height="64" alt="F" /></span>OR the side grounds, you are to fill them with variety of alleys,
private, to give a full shade, some of them, wheresoever the sun be.
You are to frame some of them likewise for shelter, that when the wind
blows sharp, you may walk as in a gallery. And those alleys must be
likewise hedged at both ends, to keep out the wind; and these closer
alleys must be ever finely <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>gravelled, and no grass, because of going
wet. In many of these alleys likewise, you are to set fruit trees of
all sorts; as well upon the walls as in ranges. And this would be
generally observed, that the borders wherein you plant your fruit trees
be fair and large, and low, and not steep; and set with fine flowers,
but thin and sparingly, lest they deceive the trees. At the end of both
the side grounds, I would have a mount of some pretty height, leaving
the wall of the inclosure breast high, to look abroad into the fields.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 230px;">
<img src="images/0034.jpg" width="230" height="20" alt="" />
</div>
<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 70px;">
<img src="images/f.jpg" width="70" height="64" alt="F" /></span>OR the main garden, I do not deny but there should be some fair
alleys, ranged on both sides, with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>fruit trees, and some pretty tufts
of fruit trees, and arbours with seats, set in some decent order; but
these to be by no means set too thick, but to leave the main garden
so as it be not close, but the air open and free. For as for shade,
I would have you rest upon the alleys of the side grounds, there to
walk, if you be disposed, in the heat of the year or day; but to
make account, that the main garden is for the more temperate parts
of the year; and in the heat of summer, for the morning and the evening,
or overcast days.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/0035.jpg" width="350" height="20" alt="" />
</div>
<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 70px;">
<img src="images/f.jpg" width="70" height="64" alt="F" /></span>OR aviaries, I like them not, except they be of that largeness, as
they may be turfed, and have living <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>plants and bushes set in them;
that the birds may have more scope, and natural nestling, and that no
foulness appear in the floor of the aviary.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 198px;">
<img src="images/0036.jpg" width="198" height="20" alt="" />
</div>
<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 70px;">
<img src="images/s.jpg" width="70" height="67" alt="S" /></span>O I have made a platform of a princely garden, partly by precept,
partly by drawing; not a model, but some general lines of it; and in
this I have spared for no cost. But it is nothing for great princes,
that for the most part, taking advice with workmen, with no less cost
set their things together; and sometimes add statues, and such things,
for state and magnificence, but nothing to the true pleasure of a
garden.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
